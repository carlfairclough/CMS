This is the default gallery plugin for the CMS.
You can create your own plugins by simply creating a directory within /plugins, which contains config.txt and function.php. You can include other files, but they must be included via plugin.php

This must be wrapped in the section separator of four dashes. The example below is functional, and enables this plugin.
